## How to solve the error "There are no files in this bucket" in the Neural Network Modeler tutorial? 

This question regards the optional exercise "Neural Network Modeler". 

We received an error "There are no files in this bucket", when following the tutorial at Step 2, 4. d - even though the files were in the bucket. (Side note: Neural Network Modeler is in beta mode) 

If you also recive this error, here is a workaround that worked for us - manually adding the COS connection to the project. 

In Watson Studio: 
_Add to project_ --> _Connection_
